# Adaptive-Physics-Informed-System-Modeling
Code for 'Adaptive Physics-Informed System Modeling (APSM) for Online Structural Dynamic Simulation.' The APSM algorithm addresses challenges like nonlinear dynamics, noise, and data sparsity by leveraging real-time monitoring data and integrating residual-based updates with fundamental physical principles.
